/* HULL materials — the exterior shell behind REFIT ▧ SURFACE → ▥ SHELL.

   Asserted through StationBake.sampleHull rather than a full bake(), for the same reason the deck
   and wall material tests are: the headless canvas mock collapses gradients and stubs source-in /
   destination-out, so a real bake's skirt comes out of it as garbage regardless of what the recipes
   painted. The recipe output itself is what these tests can actually see, and it is what the REFIT
   palette chips draw too.

   THE LOAD-BEARING PROPERTY IS THE LEGACY ONE. `station` at a null hue must emit the five literal
   constants the shell was painted with before this axis existed, or every station already built
   changes appearance on upgrade and every Guardian golden has to be re-blessed. That is asserted
   colour-by-colour below and it is the test to look at first when a hull change breaks something. */

   This block used to assert the opposite: that `station` at a null hue emitted the pre-axis
   constants VERBATIM, so every station already built stayed pixel-identical. That guarantee was
   the defect. A room on those constants was not wearing the STATION skin — it could not be
   re-toned, it did not answer to the catalog, and beside a re-clad neighbour it read as a
   different material (Andrew, on his own save: "the default still has the previous default mixed
   in ... make sure the previous shell walls are 100% gone").

   What replaces it is the property that actually matters, and it is strictly stronger:
     · the DEFAULT still LOOKS like the shipped shell — every pre-axis tone has a counterpart
       within a couple of units per channel, so nobody's station visibly changed;
     · but it is reached through the ordinary (material → hue → ramp) path, so the same ladder

/* ---------- TWO SKINS MAY NOT FIGHT OVER THE SAME SKIRT PIXEL ----------
   Andrew, 2026-08-06: "if you change multiple shells it will break the whole texture system and
   start glitching out other different separate room textures ... sometimes they half render."
   Cause: each hull group was composited with `destination-over`, so THE FIRST GROUP DRAWN won every
   contested pixel and the order was just where rooms sat in G.allRects. A footprint's plate reaches
   `pad` past its floor and its skirt hangs `skirt` further, so on a real station most rooms contend.
   A room's skirt therefore appeared only in the strip its neighbour had not already claimed and
   stopped dead at the boundary — and re-cladding ANY room moved rooms between groups and reshuffled
   the draw, which is why one change appeared to corrupt unrelated rooms.

   Ownership is geometry, not draw order: a skirt pixel belongs to the footprint DIRECTLY ABOVE it,
   the nearer one where two qualify. Proven by pixel diff in dev/shellglitch.mjs (chunk parity and
   incremental re-clad, both 0 across nine simultaneous skins) — a real canvas is required, which the
   headless mock cannot provide, so what is locked here is that the pass exists and that the
   ownership mask, not the composite order, is what separates the groups. */
