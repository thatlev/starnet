/* node test/onboarding.test.js — source-level honesty invariants for THE AWAKENING (frontend/app/onboarding.js).

   onboarding.js is browser-flow code (an IIFE over World / Chat / Dialogue globals), not node-loadable, so —
   exactly like beat-coordination.test.js and lint-emits.js — we lock its invariants by reading the source.

   THE INVARIANT: every awakening beat that writes a dossier DIMENSION (a `dossierDim` beat, as opposed to a
   `field` beat that authors a .md config doc) must target a REAL dossier dimension. A typo would make
   Dossier.upsert silently reject the answer (unknown-dim guard) — the same "silently drop a belief" failure
   that interview.test.js guards for the intake interview. PAIN (Slice 6) and AMBITION (Slice 7) are such beats. */
