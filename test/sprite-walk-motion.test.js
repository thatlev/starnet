/* Every shipped walk cycle must (a) be drawn on the same build as its own idle, and (b) actually
   re-pose the body rather than repeat the standing pose.

   Both defects reached players. Skeleton's walk came back from the 8-direction rebuild rendered
   28-38% larger than its rotations — assemble8 foot-anchors each frame independently, so the
   frames all sit on the floor line and only the SIZE betrays it. Pikachu's walk came back as six
   near-copies of the standing pose, because the walk template needs legs to swing and its feet
   never separate; in the world that reads as a body shimmering in place while it slides.

   ⛔ WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH: a walk cycle that is six copies of the standing pose. Three
   candidate measures were built and every one of them was thrown away for failing against real
   art — raw frame-to-frame churn (the dud produced MORE change than the real walk it replaced,
   5288 px vs 1752, because unstructured outline noise touches every edge at once); head-top lift
   and foot-band spread (both fail correct art — a stride leaves the head where it is, and
   pikachu's legs alternate IN PLACE without parting); and the density of change in the lower body
   over the upper (promising on the masters at dud 0.76x vs real 1.16-2.96x, but it PASSES the
   original dud and inverts entirely through the live renderer, where the dud reads 1.07x and a
   healthy capybara 0.97x). Pikachu's dead walk shipped and was caught by a human watching it, not
   by a number. Do not add a motion threshold here without first proving it FAILS ec7bc352's
   pikachu and PASSES all 38 sets. */
