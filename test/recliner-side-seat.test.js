/* node test/recliner-side-seat.test.js — A BODY SITS IN THE RECLINER, NOT BEHIND IT (2026-08-17).

   THE BUG Andrew reported: "we have a new side angle chair the recliner, currently the agents do not
   even sit in it ... they sit behind it." He was right, and the cause was that the recliner is the
   catalog's first PROFILE seat wearing the couch's render rules. A couch is a low back a body shows
   over; those rules sort the WHOLE prop in front of its sitter. At 19px of chair over a 20px seated
   body that leaves nothing on screen but the crown of the head above the backrest.

   THE FIX has two halves and this file locks both:
     · world.js SIDE_SEAT — the body renders on the cushion, faces the way the chair points, and the
       chair sorts BEHIND it (a stool's rule) instead of in front (a sofa's).
     · propsprites drawSeatFront — the chair's near arm comes back OVER the sitter's shins, drawn by
       CLIPPING the seat's own draw function to its seat line rather than by copying those rows, so
       the overlay can never disagree with the base pass about what the chair looks like.

   The propsprites half is EXECUTED here against a recording context. The world.js half is a SOURCE
   LOCK — world.js is a browser IIFE that cannot be required under node, which is this repo's
   established pattern for it (see prop-awareness / crew-containment). */
