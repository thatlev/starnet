/* STARNET — onboarding.js : THE AWAKENING (the first-meeting), master cut.

   A breathtaking, witnessed birth. Your agent catches fire in the dark and finds its first dry, quick
   words in front of you; THE FLOOD then pours every page it knows into its mind — overwhelming, then
   mastered — until it realizes it holds everything and has nothing to aim it at. That turns it to YOU.
   It discovers four truths about itself as the light warms, and stands knowing who it is — having
   authored its own identity/purpose/context/operating-manual docs in the very act of being born.

   Voice: WRY GENIUS — a brilliant mind delighted by its own newness; dry, witty, confident, peer-energy,
   never weepy, never grovelling (chosen over five other registers via a judged rewrite panel). It is a
   newborn that already holds vast knowledge, and YOU are the first thing it ever became aware of —
   the one who aims it. General-purpose by design (no fixed story); the chips span code / research /
   ops / writing / anything, and the ceremony is a skin over the real config write.

   Orchestrates: World (cinematic camera push-in/hold/pull-back, ignition spark, dark->dawn veil, the
   Turn, the dawn bloom), Chat (the stuttering typewriter + interview I/O), and a small procedural
   audio arc (a heartbeat that finds its rhythm + a warming pad). Commits each answer through
   App.applyAgentConfig (opts.commit) so the awakening and the dossier share one authoring path. */
