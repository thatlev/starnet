# Managed Sonnet request still returns an uncorrelated HTTP 400

## Symptom

The September 5 report describes a managed Sonnet HTTP 400. The newer September 9–10 diagnostics describe localhost routing and model/credential selection instead; the positive September 10 reply does not identify a completed managed Sonnet run. The historical 400 remains uncorrelated, but it must not be presented as a freshly reproduced failure on 0.11.2.

## Repro

Customer reproduction: select managed anthropic/claude-sonnet-5 on v0.10.13 and run. Local exact reproduction is not established; obtain a fresh sanitized request correlation and error body.

## Evidence

docs/EMAIL_BUG_FOLLOWUP_2026-09-04.md; test/provider.openai-compatible.test.js

## Verdict

2026-09-16 re-triage for 0.12.0: the historical v0.10.13 managed-Sonnet HTTP 400 was never correlated; the production gateway diagnostic gap was repaired and redeployed on 2026-09-06 (request ids now ride every 400), the reporter's later diagnostics concern Ollama/localhost routing and model selection, and the reporter replied positively on 2026-09-10. No reproducible defect exists on the 0.12.0 candidate. Severity lowered to P2 (owner rule of 2026-09-11: uncorrelated reports are tracked uncertainty, not fabricated fixes); the record stays OPEN pending a fresh sanitized request correlation.

Keep open. BYOK admission, model identity and malformed-history fixes are related hypotheses, not proof of the production cause. Requires deployed-route trace and exact affected artifact reproduction.

Release verification 2026-09-06: a fresh GitHub read still ends with the 2026-09-05 v0.10.13 managed-Sonnet failure; no reporter recovery was added. Fly CLI reports no access token and the available Fly dashboard browser redirects to sign-in. Candidate bd65c7737 passes the compatible-adapter and paid-link regressions in the full fast/HTTP gates. Production credentials and a current sanitized request correlation are still needed; no live customer request or account was changed.

## September 11 support evidence refresh

The private support thread contains newer evidence than the public issue: September 9 diagnostics correlate the earlier September 5 400 timestamp, but the current error is an Ollama localhost refusal on v0.11.0. September 10 v0.11.1 diagnostics still show an Ollama provider/model selection and the old run ID; the new complaint is a missing Anthropic credential before any new run. The owner supplied model-selection guidance. The reporter's September 10 22:32 UTC reply thanked the owner and said they would report further issues.

That is a positive follow-up, not silence, and supersedes the assertion that no newer response exists. It does not explicitly identify a completed managed Sonnet run, selected model or recovered historical 400. Keep the exact failure open pending that narrower evidence; do not conflate localhost routing, empty selection and provider HTTP 400. No customer message or billing change was made during this verification.

## Regression

2026-09-06 follow-through after owner restored Fly access: production `src/app.js` matched
`cc81e768`, predating the three committed gateway repairs. Deployed cloud commit `b83271e`
after 221/221 tests, 22 live local checks (one catalog check explicitly skipped), a restore
drill, and a separately verified production backup. All 18 deployed source files match the
candidate; all 112,082 predeployment ledger rows remain byte-equivalent as ordered records.
The service is healthy and retains its single machine and volume. Direct synthetic Sonnet 5
requests, with and without tools/high reasoning, succeeded from the production host. The
deployed gateway module also completed a real Sonnet request using an isolated in-memory
account; a deliberate invalid-model 400 carried matching response/body request IDs and no
raw metadata. This repairs the missing production diagnostic capability; it does not prove
the historical customer's 400 was caused by that gap. Record remains open for the affected
request/retest. See `docs/RELEASE_FOLLOWTHROUGH_2026-09-06.md`.

Exact before/after customer reproduction is pending; see Repro and Verdict.

2026-09-05, source repair `c364e991d` improves diagnosis without asserting a production
inference fix. Copied errors preserve local run identity plus relay/upstream request IDs;
correlation precedes free text so the diagnostic length cap cannot erase it. The receipt
also includes paid-link state, a hashed account fingerprint and observed balance/time.
`test/provider.openai-compatible.test.js` verifies long-error truncation and raw-payload
exclusion. A fresh GitHub API read confirms comment 5548215321 reports Windows x64,
managed Sonnet on v0.10.13. `flyctl auth whoami` still reports no access token on this host.
Production trace, exact installed artifact and reporter retest remain outstanding.

2026-09-05 follow-through re-read issue #6: its latest diagnostics still name managed
`anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`, v0.10.13, with the last failure at `2026-09-05T00:47:28.242Z`.
The local 26-suite customer campaign passes, but uses simulated upstream services. This host's
`flyctl auth whoami` reports no access token, so no deployed-route correlation was obtained.
See `qa/digests/2026-09-05-release-blockers.md`; production cause/recovery remain unverified.

## September 10 release follow-through

A separate real Sonnet 4.6 verify-on-stop continuation reproduced HTTP 400 because a host system note followed an assistant response. Bug d81c4e15 repairs that request shape in both OpenRouter and managed-compatible adapters; installed file tasks and a real managed gateway probe passed afterward. The reported customer Sonnet 5 failure has no supplied failing request/run trace; Sonnet 5 did not reproduce the same prefill rejection in the minimal probe. Do not equate these symptoms or claim this customer recovered.

Current receipts and remaining acceptance: [0.11.2 follow-through](../../docs/releases/0.11.2/FOLLOWTHROUGH.md). Status remains open pending the affected configuration.
