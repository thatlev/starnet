# Mac boot guard reports shared specialty catalog load failure

## Symptom

Opening StarNet produces a page-side boot-guard failure naming `shared/specialties.js` as the single failed script. The reported page path is `/`; the user agent identifies Mac WebKit. The report does not include the application version, full origin, requested resource URL, or native startup log.

## Repro

Customer operation: open the reported installation and observe the boot guard. Exact local reproduction is not established. Capture the affected build, full page/resource origins, native startup log and HTTP status for the failed resource before changing or resetting the station.

## Evidence

Sanitized support report dated September 10, 2026, with boot report timestamp `2026-09-10T12:24:11.768Z`: `scripts failed: shared/specialties.js`; `page errors: 1 script load failure(s): shared/specialties.js`.

Anchors: `frontend/index.html:850` builds the parser-ordered script URL from the shell-injected API origin; `test/bootguard.test.js` retains fatal handling for actual shared-module failures; `test/website-deploy-staging.test.js` checks the separate website upload tree.

September 11 installed Windows candidate `7f6c7b005`: SharedSpecialties was loaded, no boot-fatal element was present, and the script's actual loopback URL returned HTTP 200 with bytes matching the committed catalog (SHA-256 `b346c34841d2b2b75eb77dabd2e9c47049a85738a56e001d73eecd4933f41893`). Evidence is retained in the release preparation worktree `.dogfood/customer-execution/installed-catalog.json`. This does not establish Mac recovery.

## Verdict

2026-09-16 source hardening for 0.12.0 (788578969): shared/specialties.js is the one boot script the desktop page fetches from the sidecar port, so an engine that answers late paints exactly this banner and RELOAD clears it. BootGuard now retries a failed shared/ catalog load with backoff (~27 s, the shell port-wait window) and, after a proven successful retry, reloads the page once (bounded to two auto-reloads per tab) so the parser-ordered modules bind the real catalog; only spent retries render the fatal banner, which now records the retry ledger for support. Covered by test/bootguard.test.js (retry success, exhaustion, reload budget, no retry for bundled app/ scripts) and proven live over CDP with a first request to /shared/specialties.js forced to fail. The original Mac origin and build remain uncorrelated; this closes the symptom class under the owner engineering-acceptance rule of 2026-09-11.

Source hardening is included; affected-machine recovery remains pending. A fresh September 16 private reply identifies the installed Mac app and confirms that the public version still fails. It does not retest unpublished 0.12.0. The separate credit-usage concern is tracked independently and is not explained by this source fix. Do not merge this symptom into eaaa3ec8 (native station data unreachable after relink) without evidence. A September 13 Windows Edge report also names the shared catalog, but its full origin/build is unknown; it does not prove the same deployment or cause.

## Regression

No exact before/after customer reproduction yet. Current Windows module loading passes. A cross-origin fetch probe is not equivalent to a classic script load; neither its CORS rejection nor a successful HTTP request alone establishes page boot health.

## Sibling coverage
