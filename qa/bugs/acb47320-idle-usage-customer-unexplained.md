# Customer cannot explain idle behavior and unexpectedly high usage

## Symptom

Customer sees idle agents and unexpected usage without a clear explanation of scheduled work.

## Repro

Collect the affected run ledger, chosen provider/model, armed routines/loops/night shift and expected work cadence, then reconcile usage to actual work.

## Evidence

docs/EMAIL_BUG_FOLLOWUP_2026-09-04.md; test/provider-recovery.e2e.test.js

## Verdict

2026-09-16 re-triage for 0.12.0 (owner release rule of 2026-09-11: reports without an established cause stay tracked as uncertainty, never fabricated as fixed): the affected run ledger, provider receipts and armed background work were never supplied, the 0.11.2 installed canary showed no idle spend, and no reproducible defect exists on the 0.12.0 candidate. Severity lowered to P2 so an unreproducible historical report cannot block a release it does not describe; the record stays OPEN pending the affected account evidence.

Open investigation, not an established billing defect. No customer run ledger was supplied. Seeded idle awaiting orders is not itself a scheduler failure; do not fix by inventing activity or adding arbitrary caps.

Release verification 2026-09-06: the exact bd65c7737 Guardian and 130/130 journey assertions pass, including idle-state truth checks. The owner's installed station reports zero active runs and retains a healthy daily routine after upgrade; that is a different station, not a substitute for the affected customer's usage ledger. No affected-account cost reconciliation or customer recovery can be claimed without the missing run/provider/background-work evidence.

## Regression

Exact before/after customer reproduction is pending; see Repro and Verdict.

## September 10 release follow-through

The installed Windows canary on fbaab109f completed twenty minutes idle with no usage increase, followed by three renderer recovery faults. Real task costs matched their run receipts; an isolated managed gateway probe debited exactly its recorded 0.000683 cost. This does not identify the affected account's unexplained usage. Its run ledger, armed background work and provider receipts remain required.

Current receipts and remaining acceptance: [0.11.2 follow-through](../../docs/releases/0.11.2/FOLLOWTHROUGH.md). Status remains open pending the affected configuration.
