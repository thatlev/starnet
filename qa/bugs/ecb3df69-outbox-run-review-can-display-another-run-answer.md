# Outbox run review can display another run answer

## Symptom

A review crate can pair its original request and rating target with a later answer from the same session.

## Repro

Execute the unchanged rendering block with crate runId A and a transcript containing request/answer A followed by request/answer B. It displays request A and answer B. This is a source reproduction, not a paid live transcript.

See qa/seam-audit-0912/REPORT.md finding A7 for exact scope and repair criteria.

## Evidence

Code anchor: frontend/app/windows/outbox.js:127. Receipt: `outbox-output-attributed-to-wrong-run` in qa/seam-audit-0912/probe-results.json or ui-observations.json. Source baseline 091d6e7f3; product files unchanged through fa85f521f. Repro code is qa/seam-audit-0912/probe.cjs and controlled UI fixture server is fault-proxy.cjs. Evidence class and coverage limits are explicit in the report; no installer proof claimed.

## Verdict

Run attribution is filtered before limiting across memory, segmented history and HTTP restart. Live Outbox loaded one matching transcript only on expansion. Evidence: test/transcript.test.js, test/transcript-history-v2.test.js and test/seam-audit-recovery.http.test.js. See qa/seam-audit-0912/REPAIR.md for final gate receipts and exact scope. Source repaired; installer and affected-customer recovery remain unverified.

## Regression

test/transcript.test.js, test/transcript-history-v2.test.js and test/seam-audit-recovery.http.test.js
