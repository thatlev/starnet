# Loop polling erases the rejection explanation being typed

## Symptom

A typed rejection explanation vanishes and its editor closes while the user is composing it.

## Repro

Run the local fault proxy, open Automation Goal loops, click REJECT on the candidate, type a reason, and let the four-second refresh run. UI reads change from the typed text with hidden false to empty with hidden true.

See qa/seam-audit-0912/REPORT.md finding A5 for exact scope and repair criteria.

## Evidence

Code anchor: frontend/app/windows/loops.js:303. Receipt: `loop-review-draft-reset` in qa/seam-audit-0912/probe-results.json or ui-observations.json. Source baseline 091d6e7f3; product files unchanged through fa85f521f. Repro code is qa/seam-audit-0912/probe.cjs and controlled UI fixture server is fault-proxy.cjs. Evidence class and coverage limits are explicit in the report; no installer proof claimed.

## Verdict

Final-source live UI retained the rejection editor, text and focus across polls and changed relative timestamps. Unchanged rows keep their DOM identity. Evidence: qa/seam-audit-0912/repair-ui-observations.json. See qa/seam-audit-0912/REPAIR.md for final gate receipts and exact scope. Source repaired; installer and affected-customer recovery remain unverified.
