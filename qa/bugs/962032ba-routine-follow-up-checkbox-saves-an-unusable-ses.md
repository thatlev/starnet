# Routine follow-up checkbox saves an unusable session origin

## Symptom

A saved routine with follow-up enabled is rejected by the scheduler because it has no captured conversation.

## Repro

In New schedule leave Keep in StarNet selected, check Allow follow-up, fill name and prompt, save. Inspect job: attachToSession true, origin null. Actual cronPreflightConfig returns missing-session-origin. This persisted through an isolated sidecar restart.

See qa/seam-audit-0912/REPORT.md finding A3 for exact scope and repair criteria.

## Evidence

Code anchor: frontend/app/windows/routines.js:653. Receipt: `routine-follow-up-without-origin` in qa/seam-audit-0912/probe-results.json or ui-observations.json. Source baseline 091d6e7f3; product files unchanged through fa85f521f. Repro code is qa/seam-audit-0912/probe.cjs and controlled UI fixture server is fault-proxy.cjs. Evidence class and coverage limits are explicit in the report; no installer proof claimed.

## Verdict

Local delivery with follow-up captures the session; create/update validation rejects a missing local-session origin inside the write lock while preserving channel-history follow-up. Live UI save and sidecar restart read-back passed. Evidence: test/seam-audit-recovery.http.test.js, test/cron.api.test.js and test/routine-origin-race.test.js. See qa/seam-audit-0912/REPAIR.md for final gate receipts and exact scope. Source repaired; installer and affected-customer recovery remain unverified.

## Regression

test/seam-audit-recovery.http.test.js, test/cron.api.test.js and test/routine-origin-race.test.js
