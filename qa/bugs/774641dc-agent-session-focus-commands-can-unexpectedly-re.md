# Agent session focus commands can unexpectedly retarget the composer

## Symptom

A user reports that StarNet changes the selected session while they are not looking, so their next message lands in another conversation. Their build, platform, voice usage, and run logs were not supplied.

## Repro

1. On source 41253b0bd (package version 0.11.0), launch an isolated worktree with SKYNET_DEFAULT_MODEL=replay, SKYNET_PORT=18949 and node dev/seed.js --keep. No provider credentials are needed to inspect frontend routing.
2. Open the seeded station in Chrome and wait for initialization. Create two sessions through Workstreams.create with activate:false. Use App.openWorkstream to select the first.
3. Type an unsent draft in #chat-input.
4. Deliver the frontend handler the same verb used by the model's session.focus tool: await StationCommands.run('proof', 'station.switch_session', {session: secondSessionId}). This explicitly injects the trigger; it does not demonstrate an actual model choosing the tool unprompted.
5. Observe the active session becomes the second without a rail click. Type a follow-up intended for the original session and click #chat-send.
6. Read both Workstreams records: the user turn appears in the second session. Return to the first: its earlier draft is preserved.

## Evidence

Real seeded app, Chrome headless via Playwright; DOM/state round-trip on 2026-09-09:

```json
{
  "before": {"active":"Original session","draft":"Unsent original draft"},
  "after": {"active":"Other session","draft":""},
  "history": {
    "original": [],
    "other": [{"role":"user","content":"Follow-up intended for Original session"}]
  },
  "restoredOriginalDraft": "Unsent original draft"
}
```

The test used a fresh browser context and only the scratch workspace. No real provider request was observed; this proves the selected session and frontend user-turn routing, not model execution or backend delivery. No customer data was accessed.

Trace:
- sidecar/tools/builtin/station.js:88: session.focus is model-callable. Its description says to use it only when asked, but its handler forwards only the session reference.
- sidecar/station-bridge.js:57: emitted payload is id, verb, args. There is no originating stream or user-navigation generation for a stale/background-focus check.
- frontend/app/stationcommands.js:261: station.switch_session unconditionally calls Workstreams.switch and Chat.load for a valid target. The listener passes no originating context to the handler.
- frontend/app/stationcommands.js:240: station.new_session with focus:true is a sibling automatic focus path.
- frontend/app/chat.js:1228: Chat.load repoints activeWs; Channels.setComposeTarget follows the displayed session.
- frontend/app/group-chat.js:142: composerDrafts preserves each session's unsent text. The current defect is unexpected navigation and subsequent input routing, not old draft text being silently copied into another session.
- frontend/app/voice-live.js:576: ensureBoundFocus switches the visible session back to the call's bound session before handleTranscript processes speech. Code-traced, not reproduced with a microphone. It may explain a voice-specific version of the report.

Existing tests pass: node test/station-commands.test.js (128 assertions), node test/station-tools.test.js (63 assertions). They verify successful focus commands and default non-focusing creation, but do not establish that a focus request is still current user navigation intent.

## Verdict

Source-fixed in 086a74ba5d499f74d1829978291eeadeb22848f5; generated website mirror synchronized in 697126681. The confirmed delayed-voice-reply jump is removed. Model focus requests now carry execution-context stream/run identity and require the still-current foreground run, unchanged UI navigation generation, and an empty composer without attachments. Upload-time navigation invalidates a pending submission. Deliberate session clicks and a valid current-run focus request still work.

The reporter's exact run/platform and whether they were using voice remain unknown. This fixes reproduced mechanisms matching the symptom; it does not establish installer delivery or customer recovery. Live voice remains bound to its starting session. Explicit new speech continues to address that bound session; incoming assistant speech no longer navigates.

## September 16 follow-up — delivery and connector navigation

The owner relayed the continuing complaint: sessions switch while typing. The September 9 repair addressed voice/model focus and stale sends, but not delivery reveal or delayed connector continuation. On baseline 1cbd6384d (source version 0.12.0), live seeded Chrome showed workshop.built change the selected session to workshop-typing-live and replace the visible draft with an empty composer. This is a reopened symptom record, not a claim that every earlier repaired path regressed.

The new guard covers a focused composer, any draft including whitespace, and staged/uploading attachments. Delivery push, attach poll and return poll preserve focus while retaining unread delivery sessions; explicit review remains available. Connector rechecks retain their handoff and dispatch nothing when navigation changes or composition begins during the wait. Desktop and website copies receive the same fix. No installed artifact or reporter recovery is claimed.

## Regression

September 16 regression: test/session-typing-safety.test.js failed before repair with selected workshop-live instead of original. The seeded baseline repeated that visible failure. After repair, the live delivery/attach/return checks preserved the draft and attachment; the next Send reached only the original session; delayed connector completion preserved focus and its handoff, and a deliberate retry started one run. Reload retained the original turn. Existing voice/model/upload safety tests remain required; explicit foreground model navigation retains its prior empty-composer behavior. Reproducible runner: scripts/qa/session-typing-live.cjs.

Before: the actual seeded browser callback for a delayed assistant reply changed the selected title from Reading and typing to Voice call and replaced draft for reading session with an empty composer. The callback was exposed for deterministic invocation without altering its logic; no microphone/provider was required. The new test/session-focus-safety.test.js failed on the original callback with expected reading, actual call.

Independent before-fix attachment proof, executing the original submitComposer function from git: after upload completion the sent turn was {session:other,text:origin message}, and the other draft became empty.

After: scripts/qa/session-focus-live.cjs passes in the real seeded app with eight controls: delayed reply leaves selection/draft/binding intact; the subsequent Send records the message only in the selected session; current foreground request succeeds; background focus and focused creation refuse without partial creation; leaving and returning cannot revive old focus; current draft blocks focus; upload navigation sends to neither session and preserves the new draft. Zero browser page errors. Model transport and attachment upload completion are controlled; no paid model or real microphone/installer execution is claimed.

Focused gates: session-focus-safety, station-commands (135 assertions), station-tools (67 assertions), voice-live-ui, and voice-flow passed. Full repair-candidate gates passed: npm run test:fast (734/734), npm run test:http (106/106), and npm run qa:customer-journeys (33/33). The original loop/git HTTP fixture had transient load-sensitive failures, then passed unchanged both alone and in the complete HTTP rerun. After syncing trunk 32a1e304e, live proof passed again and candidate 0d99faf75 passed the complete fast (734/734) and HTTP (107/107) gates. A later conflict-free sync of independent image-intent work was checked with its changed tests plus session-focus regressions; these incremental checks are separate from the full-gate receipt. Do not infer installer or customer recovery from source tests.

Reproducible live runner: scripts/qa/session-focus-live.cjs. Run against an isolated dev/seed.js --keep instance only, using STARNET_PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE and STARNET_CHROME when the browser runtime is bundled externally. Captured output: qa/evidence/session-focus-0909.json.
