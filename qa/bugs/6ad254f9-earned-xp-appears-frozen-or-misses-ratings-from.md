# Earned XP appears frozen or misses ratings from another window

## Symptom

Customer says they miss XP working; their exact version/action is unavailable. The investigation reproduced an open Growth panel showing old XP after a successful rating, and a second window permanently missing another window's acknowledged rating after it submits newer feedback.

## Repro

1. Launch an isolated station with `node dev/seed.js --keep` and a deterministic local tool-capable provider. Complete and positively rate two tasks, reaching 60 XP / level 2.
2. Keep the dossier Growth tab open. Complete and rate a third task. Before repair the saved agent has 90 XP / three approvals, but the open panel still shows 60 XP / two approvals.
3. Open another station window at 90 XP. Rate a fourth task in the first window, then a fifth in the second. Before repair the second projection has only four approvals (129 XP / level 2) despite five durable ratings. Reloading retains that missing credit.
4. `node test/growth-rating-upgrade.e2e.test.js` reproduces the checkpoint failure with real sidecar runs, the production XP adapter and a real process restart.

## Evidence

Live source baseline 7a087d3be, isolated loopback :21980. Third run 139b9811-43ea-4c74-9260-2fc61a9cae90: clicking the actual control showed `★ +XP`; `agent.save.json` held `{xp:90,level:2,ratings:3}`, while the already-open panel still showed `60 total XP` and `POSITIVE FEEDBACK 2`.

Fourth/fifth runs 095610d9-2fe8-4bb9-808e-4816ad29967a and c8f4b458-b2a8-457c-8312-9d6e6e6826e3 demonstrated the lost-rating checkpoint across two browser windows. Before the XP-store repair, the updated real-run regression failed: expected 129 XP, got 90; expected four hero approvals, got three (plus one specialist approval). After the repair it passes 31 assertions.

Live after repair: the already-open Growth panel advanced from 90 to 129 XP without crossing a level; recovery of the previously stranded second-window projection displayed `168 total XP`, five approvals and level 3 (`18 / 150 XP`, `132 XP TO LV 4`). The actual second rating had earlier displayed NOVA REACHED LEVEL 2 and the crew rail changed to Lv 2.

Source seams: `frontend/app/stationui.js` refreshGrowthLive / refreshDossierLive; `frontend/app/xpstore.js` recordWorkRating / syncRatingHistory / init. Regressions: test/dossier-growth-live.test.js, test/xpstore.test.js, test/growth-rating-upgrade.e2e.test.js. Local detailed receipts are retained in `.dogfood/xp/` in the owning worktree.

Final live checks: a fresh browser origin after a real sidecar restart recovered 168 XP / five approvals / level 3. Further ratings produced exactly the ledger-derived totals: NOVA 213 XP / level 3, XP-SPEC 90 XP / level 2. The specialist showed its own level-up broadcast, retained level 2 on reload, and its already-open panel advanced 60 to 90 XP. The overseer did not inherit specialist XP. Commander progression independently moved from 10 points / level 1 to 110 points / level 2 after a real goal-linked test run and explicit confirmation of the synthetic test outcome. Browser error log was empty.

Candidate e064281ed: `npm run test:fast` 780/780 PASS (`.dogfood/xp/fast-locked.log`); `npm run qa:customer-journeys` 34/34 PASS (`.dogfood/xp/journeys-final.log`). Focused XP-store 101, growth-dossier 10, real-run upgrade/restart 31 and claim-lock 64 assertions PASS. The earlier gates correctly caught an in-flight website-mirror mismatch and changed source hashes; the final candidate has a synchronized mirror and updated source locks with all claim verdicts unchanged.

## Verdict

The open dossier refreshed only status, not XP or kudos. The rating adapter incorrectly treated a single acknowledgement as proof that all preceding ratings had been consumed. Repair refreshes read-only progression independently of editors and advances the rating checkpoint only after a complete history snapshot. Older checkpoints receive one safe replay when the saved receipt history has not reached its eviction cap. Capped histories retain their prior checkpoint rather than risking duplicate awards; older missing receipts in that exceptional case are not claimed recovered. The new customer's exact cause and recovery remain unconfirmed. The reproduced source defects are repaired and verified; no installer or public release is claimed.

## Regression

Before: ordinary positive feedback left the open panel stale, and a later local rating could permanently hide earlier external feedback behind its checkpoint. After: XP/kudos repaint during the existing dossier tick; canonical history is folded chronologically, local feedback celebrates once, failed history reads preserve the previous checkpoint, and restart recovery retains all acknowledged ratings without duplicates.
