# Telegram-bound lead reports crew delegation unavailable

## Symptom

After upgrading to Windows 0.11.2, a lead can delegate to a specialist in the desktop chat but reportedly says team.dispatch is unavailable when invoked through its assigned Telegram bot. The reporter says team dispatch is enabled and the bot binding is correct.

## Repro

1. Enable team dispatch; create a lead and specialist and prove delegation in desktop COMMS.
2. Bind the Telegram bot to the same lead and send the same task through an admitted owner DM.
3. Capture task classification, bound agent ID, authority scope, provider tool schema and any tool-search result, then the actual dispatch result.
4. Repeat after restart and compare specialist bindings and group-channel policy. The exact customer failure has not been reproduced locally.

## Evidence

GitHub #14 was read on 2026-09-16 UTC. It was created after 0.11.2 publication and closed at 2026-09-11T21:22:02Z; the issue has no comments, and the closure event has no linked commit. Closure alone does not prove a fix or recovery. This symptom is distinct from #13 / acd9ecb4, which concerns MCP access inside a delegated worker.

`test/channels.telegram.e2e.test.js` already asserts that an owner Telegram task advertises team_dispatch and that /tools lists delegation authority. `test/e2e.dispatch-session.test.js` covers separate dispatch/session behavior. These are relevant baseline protections; neither supplies the failing customer input or proves this exact report resolved. Source entry points: `sidecar/index.js:8082` and `sidecar/tools/builtin/orchestration.js`.

## Verdict

Open investigation, imported during 0.12.0 preparation because the closed public issue had no durable symptom record. Obtain a sanitized reproduction or establish and repair an independently reproduced cause. Do not weaken channel authority or add unconditional delegation to conversational turns to make the report disappear.

## Regression

Source follow-through `887210a7b` reproduces and repairs a related briefing mismatch: trusted owner tasks advertised delegation but received no orchestration/crew briefing because only desktop callers set `o.lead`. The briefing now follows the tools actually granted. The before test failed the owner-task briefing assertion; the repaired `test/channels.telegram.e2e.test.js` passes 82 assertions. The same persisted lead delegates to the same named specialist through desktop and owner Telegram, receives the specialist result through the real tool loop, and repeats after sidecar restart. Workers receive neither recursive delegation nor the lead briefing. Raw receipts: `.dogfood/release-followthrough/telegram-before.log` and `telegram-after.log`.

This establishes source parity and a real adjacent defect, not the missing original provider/tool trace. Keep the customer report open; its claim that the tool was absent has not been reproduced. Installed Telegram acceptance and affected-user recovery remain owed.
